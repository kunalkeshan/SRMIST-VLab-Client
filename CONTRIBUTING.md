## üöÄ Getting Started

When contributing to VLab **Client**, it's good to know our best practices, tips, and tricks. VLab Client is built using React-JavaScript. Uses Material UI components and fetches the resources from the [service application](https://github.com/kunalkeshan/SRMIST-VLab-Service).

### Prerequisites

It's recommended that you have a basic knowledge of how to work with the MERN stack, before actually contributing to it. Of course, if you're not familiar with the stack, you can always open an [issue](https://github.com/kunalkeshan/SRMIST-VLab-Client/issues/new) to express your opinions.

**Software requirements**:

- Latest version of Git - [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)*
- LTS Release of Node.js - [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)*
- MongoDB - [https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/) (optional) or
- MongoDB Atlas - [https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)*

### Starting Service Application

If you're contributing to the pages related to the subjects and experiments, you'll need to have the [service application](https://github.com/kunalkeshan/SRMIST-VLab-Service) cloned and have some dummy data to test as well.

Steps to follow to quickly clone and get started with the **Service Application**:

**Fork and Clone the Service Repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/SRMIST-VLab-Service
```

**Install All Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

**Add Required Envs**:

Since you'll be working in development, create a `.env.development` in the root of your service application and add the following contents to the file.

```env
NODE_ENV="<node environment>"
DB_URL="<mongodb url here>"
CLIENT_URL="<client url here>"
SERVER_URL="<server url here>"
```

**Add Dummy data to Your Database**:

In your MongoDB, there should be two collections, `experiments` and `subjects`, download the dummy data below and import them into the respective collections. Make sure to download the latest version and use them.

- [Experiments](./assets/contributing/mongo/)
- [Subjects](./assets/contributing/mongo)

**Start Your Application**:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

The **service application** should run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Starting the Client Application

**Fork and Clone the Client Repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/SRMIST-VLab-Client
```

**Install All Dependencies**:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Start Your Application**:

```bash
npm run start
```
